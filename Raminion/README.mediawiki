===Description===

This program is a Dominion shuffling app for Mac that allows the user to limit the number of sets used in Dominion.

Right now, the program is incomplete, but it is planned that users will be able to choose what sets to use out of all sets contained in a JSON file.

===License===

While I do not have a license right now, I plan to place it under the MIT License, once set selection is implemented.
